    "A spam filter attempts to flag messages as spam based on the number of \"target words\", ie, the number of words likely to appear only in a spam message, it contains.  Based on the number of these target words it finds in a given message, it attempts to estimate the probability that the message is spam using Bayes Rule.  To do this, however, the filter must have an estimate of the probability of a given number of target words given that the message is spam.  Estimating this probability for all numbers of target words is the problem."
